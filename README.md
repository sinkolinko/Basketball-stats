A simple web app we (father & son) are building as we go through a Javascript course.

TODO

- Add overtime time period
- Add fouls
- Option to undo last action
- Add total points for the opponents
- Move action buttons inline
- Show player fouls
- Show team fouls
- Add option to select players (subs) on the floor and show only them in action panel
- Add active players dynamically from player list selection (no hardcoded players)

DONE

- ~~Add total score~~
- ~~Store data to online database (Firebase: EMCA Script time, team ID, player ID, action)~~
